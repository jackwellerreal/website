So something with Red Rooster happened again...

First of all, I'll give you a bit of backstory. Red Rooster is the sixth biggest restaurant in Australia, known for their fried chicken and chips. They have around 350 stores spread across the country and are a popular choice for many Australians when they want a quick meal. Around 6 months ago, I discovered an interesting security flaw in their website which allowed me to set the price of my order to $0.00 and collect it for free.
